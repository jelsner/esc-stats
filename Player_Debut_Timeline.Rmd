Given  `all_tournaments_df`, here’s what we’ll do:

1. Reshape the data from wide to long so Player1 and Player2 are combined in a single Player column.
2. Filter out any NA players (important for solo tournaments that might only list Player1).
3. Keep only data from 1977 on.
4. Find the first year each player appeared.
5. Sort by year and player name, and assign an ordinal count.

```{r}
all_tournaments_df <- read_csv(here::here("data", "output", "ddc_full_tournament_data_auto.csv"))
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Build player debut data
player_debuts <- all_tournaments_df %>%
#  filter(Location == "Tallahassee") %>%
  filter(Year >= 1977) %>%
  select(EventStartDate, Player1, Player2, Location) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Player1, Player2), names_to = "Role", values_to = "Player") %>%
  filter(!is.na(Player)) %>%
  group_by(Player) %>%
  summarise(FirstDate = min(EventStartDate),
            Location = first(Location)) %>%
  arrange(FirstDate, Player) %>%
  mutate(Count = row_number())

# Now expand this out into a timeline by player debut year
timeline_df <- player_debuts %>%
  select(Date = FirstDate, Player, Count, Location)

# View the result
print(timeline_df)
```
