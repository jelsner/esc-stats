Elo ratings: Why is it powerful? It automatically adjusts for strength of opponent: beating top players moves you up fast, beating weak players not much. Gives you a single number to rank players, but it implicitly accounts for all games played. Great for dynamic tracking: you can plot Elo vs time to see if someoneâ€™s getting better or declining.

The **Elo rating system** is a way to estimate the skill levels of players in competitive games.

It was invented by **Arpad Elo**, a Hungarian-American physics professor and chess master.\
The system became widely used in chess, but is now used for many sports and games, including online gaming and even evaluating football teams.

The system works like this:

-   Each player starts with an initial rating (commonly 1500).
-   When two players (or teams) play a match:
    -   The expected outcome is calculated based on the difference in their ratings.
    -   If a player performs better than expected (wins against a stronger opponent), they gain more points.
    -   If a player performs worse than expected (loses to a weaker opponent), they lose more points.
-   The **K-factor** controls how much the ratings adjust after each game.

The expected score (probability of winning) is:

$$
E_A = \frac{1}{1 + 10^{(R_B - R_A) / 400}}
$$

where: - $R_A$ is Player Aâ€™s rating - $R_B$ is Player Bâ€™s rating

Then after the match:

$$
R'_A = R_A + K \times (S_A - E_A)
$$

where: $S_A = 1$ if A wins, $0.5$ if draw, $0$ if A loses and $K$ is the adjustment factor (commonly 32).

âœ… Itâ€™s **self-correcting**:\
If a player wins consistently, their rating rises, so future wins give less of a boost (and losses hurt more).

âœ… Itâ€™s **continuous**:\
It tracks performance game by game, without needing to wait for a whole season.

âœ… Itâ€™s **predictive**:\
A higher rating difference means a higher expected probability of winning.

-   Players with the same rating are expected to win about equally often.
-   The ratings adjust automatically to how surprising the outcomes are.
-   It can handle long histories of matchups without starting over.

Youâ€™re using this system to track and compare players like **Jim Elsner**, **Mike Prost**, and others across multiple tournaments.

By plotting Elo over time, you can see:

-   whoâ€™s improving
-   whoâ€™s consistent
-   who might be having up or down seasons.
